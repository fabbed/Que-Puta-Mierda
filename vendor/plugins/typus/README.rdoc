= Typus: Effortless admin interface for your Rails application

*Typus* is designed for a single activity:

    Trusted users editing structured content.

*Typus* doesn't try to be all the things to all the people but it's 
extensible enough to match lots of use cases.

    $ cd example.com && script/server

Step 3: Go to the admin area and enjoy it!

== Want to see a demo working?

There's an application running at Heroku.

    http://typus.heroku.com/

Use the following credentials to log in.

    Email: userdemo@intraducibles.com
    Password: userdemo

Notes on the application demo:

- Runs under SSL.
- Has an Assets model to show how assets can work.
- User can only edit the posts they have generated.
- User cannot edit Categories, just view them.
- Shows how TinyMCE is integrated with Pages.

== Installing

Install from GitHub the latest version which it's compatible with Rails 2.3.4.

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git

Once *Typus* is installed, run the generator to create required files and migrate your 
database. (<tt>typus_users</tt> table is created)

    $ script/generate typus
    $ rake db:migrate

To create the first user, start the application server, go to 
http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin and follow the instructions.
